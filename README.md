# Alert:

Only chinese language support. I don't have any time to do the translation back to english or other language.

Because this map is base on the 1.5c version and my test game version is very odd 1.20e, if there's any problem on 1.24 or newer game version, I wont help except I found any help about fix the 'return bug' cache system. if you still want play this map, maybe you need a legit copy game version 1.20e.

# Current latest beta version:
